1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

With client-side routing, content is sent from the server to the client only once. Each time the user clicks on a link in the website or web application, he or she sees different parts of that content. The entire content is already in his or her machine; only the components of the application change which renders different parts of the content. This is handled, of course, by JavaScript, or in particular, JSX.
With server-side routing, content is sent from the server to the client every single time the user clicks on a link. So, server-side routing takes more time than client-side routing, because each time a link is clicked, a request is made to the server and the server sends back a new document to the client.
